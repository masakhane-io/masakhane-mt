It com@@ forts people with the good news that God@@ ’@@ s heavenly Kingdom will soon end all wic@@ k@@ ed@@ ness and trans@@ form the earth into a parad@@ ise .
It prom@@ ot@@ es faith in Jesus Christ , who died so that we might g@@ ain everlasting life and who is now rul@@ ing as King of God@@ ’@@ s Kingdom .
This magaz@@ ine has been pub@@ lished continu@@ ously since 18@@ 7@@ 9 and is non@@ politi@@ c@@ al .
It ad@@ her@@ es to the Bible as its author@@ ity .
B@@ ebe had been very close to her father .
The rem@@ ar@@ k came from a well - mean@@ ing family friend , but B@@ ebe found it more c@@ ut@@ ting than com@@ for@@ ting .
“ His death was@@ n@@ ’@@ t for the best , ” she k@@ ept re@@ pe@@ ating to her@@ self .
It was clear that when B@@ ebe rec@@ oun@@ ted the inc@@ ident in a book years later , she was still g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing .
As B@@ ebe came to see , it can take a long time for someone to over@@ come g@@ ri@@ ef , especially when the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person was very close to the dec@@ eas@@ ed .
In the Bible , death is ap@@ tly describ@@ ed as “ the last enem@@ y . ”
It bre@@ ak@@ s into our lives with ir@@ res@@ is@@ ti@@ b@@ le for@@ ce , often when we are complet@@ ely un@@ pre@@ par@@ ed , and it ro@@ bs us of those we hold de@@ ar .
N@@ one of us are im@@ m@@ une to its r@@ av@@ ages .
So it is not sur@@ pris@@ ing if we feel at a l@@ os@@ s when it comes to cop@@ ing with death and its af@@ ter@@ m@@ ath .
Per@@ haps you have wond@@ ered : ‘ How long does it take to get over g@@ ri@@ ef ?
How can I com@@ fort others who have been b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
H@@ ave you ever had a b@@ ri@@ ef b@@ out with ill@@ ness ?
As an example , consider how the p@@ at@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch Abraham re@@ ac@@ ted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to m@@ our@@ n and to we@@ ep over S@@ ar@@ ah . ”
The ex@@ pression “ began to ” sug@@ g@@ ests that it took some time for him to cop@@ e with his l@@ os@@ s .
He g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ed for “ many days , ” and his family members were un@@ able to com@@ fort him .
S@@ ever@@ al years later , the death of Jos@@ ep@@ h still we@@ igh@@ ed heav@@ ily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , R@@ ob@@ ert , died on J@@ uly 9 , 200@@ 8 .
S@@ i@@ x years later the p@@ ain in my heart is still there .
I d@@ on@@ ’@@ t think I will ever get over my l@@ os@@ s of R@@ ob . ” ​ — G@@ a@@ il , aged 60 .
“ Although I have been without my de@@ ar wife for more than 18 years , I still mis@@ s her and g@@ ri@@ eve over my l@@ os@@ s .
Wh@@ en@@ ever I see something in n@@ ature that is at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tive , my th@@ oug@@ h@@ ts go to her , and I cannot help wond@@ ering how she would have enjoy@@ ed se@@ e@@ ing what I am se@@ e@@ ing . ” ​ — E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , aged 8@@ 4 .
C@@ learly , such p@@ ain@@ ful and long - lasting feelings are only natur@@ al .
E@@ ach person g@@ ri@@ ev@@ es in his or her own way , and it would be un@@ wise to jud@@ ge the way another person resp@@ ond@@ s to tr@@ ag@@ ed@@ y .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from con@@ dem@@ ning ourselves if our re@@ action to l@@ os@@ s se@@ ems exc@@ essi@@ ve .
As we no@@ te in the “ Im@@ itate Their F@@ a@@ ith ” article in this issu@@ e , Isa@@ a@@ c was still g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing over the l@@ os@@ s of his mother , S@@ ar@@ ah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 6@@ 7 .
For inst@@ ance , you may find that some will adv@@ ise you not to cr@@ y or show your feelings in any way .
O@@ thers may p@@ us@@ h you to do the op@@ pos@@ ite and exp@@ ose all your feelings .
The Bible pres@@ ents a more bal@@ anc@@ ed view , one that is supp@@ or@@ ted by mod@@ er@@ n res@@ ear@@ ch .
In some cul@@ tures it is consid@@ ered un@@ man@@ ly for a m@@ ale to cr@@ y .
But is there a real need to feel as@@ ham@@ ed about sh@@ ed@@ ding t@@ ears , even in pub@@ lic ?
M@@ ental - health ex@@ per@@ ts ac@@ knowledge that t@@ ear@@ ful@@ ness is a nor@@ m@@ al part of g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing .
And g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing may , in time , help you to m@@ ove on des@@ pite the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of your l@@ os@@ s .
S@@ up@@ press@@ ing g@@ ri@@ ef , however , may do more har@@ m than good .
The Bible l@@ ends no support to the no@@ tion that it is wrong or un@@ man@@ ly to sh@@ ed t@@ ears of g@@ ri@@ ef .
At the death of his de@@ ar friend L@@ az@@ ar@@ us , Jesus op@@ enly w@@ ept , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
B@@ ou@@ ts of anger are often part of g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing , especially in cas@@ es of s@@ ud@@ den , un@@ expec@@ ted death .
There are many reas@@ ons why a b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person may feel ang@@ ry , such as when th@@ oug@@ h@@ t@@ less and un@@ fo@@ und@@ ed comm@@ ents are made by a resp@@ ec@@ ted person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” expl@@ ains a S@@ outh Afr@@ ican man nam@@ ed M@@ ike .
“ At the fun@@ er@@ al , the A@@ ng@@ lic@@ an minis@@ ter said that God needs good people and t@@ akes them early .
* This ang@@ ered me because we des@@ per@@ ately needed our father .
E@@ spec@@ ially in the case of un@@ expec@@ ted death , the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person may re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly think , ‘ It might not have happ@@ ened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed by such feelings of gu@@ il@@ t and anger , it is important not to bo@@ t@@ tle up these emo@@ tions .
Rather , speak to a friend who will lis@@ ten and re@@ ass@@ ure you that such ir@@ r@@ ational feelings are common to many b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed ones .
The Bible rem@@ ind@@ s us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distr@@ ess . ” ​ — Proverbs 17 : 17 .
The best F@@ ri@@ end a b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person can have is our Creator , Jehovah God .
P@@ our out your heart to him in prayer because “ he car@@ es for you . ”
Mor@@ e@@ over , he prom@@ ises that all who do so will have their th@@ oug@@ h@@ ts and feelings so@@ oth@@ ed by “ the peace of God that sur@@ p@@ as@@ ses all under@@ standing . ”
Al@@ so , al@@ low God to help you he@@ al by means of his cons@@ ol@@ ing Word , the Bible .
H@@ aving such th@@ oug@@ h@@ ts to p@@ ond@@ er over may be especially help@@ ful at night when you are al@@ one and find it hard to s@@ le@@ ep . ​ — Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 .
R@@ ec@@ ently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will c@@ all J@@ ack , l@@ ost his bel@@ ov@@ ed wife to c@@ anc@@ er .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he expl@@ ains , “ I never feel al@@ one .
I often wa@@ ke up during the night and cannot get back to s@@ le@@ ep .
After reading and med@@ it@@ ating on com@@ for@@ ting th@@ oug@@ h@@ ts from the Scriptures and then p@@ our@@ ing out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a cal@@ m@@ ness and a trans@@ c@@ ending peace come over me , p@@ ut@@ ting my mind and heart at res@@ t and en@@ ab@@ ling me to s@@ le@@ ep . ”
A young woman nam@@ ed V@@ an@@ ess@@ a l@@ ost her mother to ill@@ ness .
She too has experi@@ enced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just c@@ all on God@@ ’@@ s name and bre@@ ak down in t@@ ears .
Jehovah lis@@ t@@ ened to my pray@@ ers and always gave me the streng@@ th I needed . ”
Some b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ement coun@@ sel@@ ors adv@@ ise those who are str@@ ug@@ gl@@ ing with g@@ ri@@ ef to get involved in help@@ ing others or to v@@ olun@@ te@@ er their time in some comm@@ unity service .
Do@@ ing so can bring joy and may ease a person@@ ’@@ s g@@ ri@@ ef .
Many b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed Christians have found that wor@@ king to help others has brought them great com@@ fort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God feel@@ s for you in your p@@ ain . ​ — Psalm 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God pati@@ ently lis@@ t@@ ens to the pray@@ ers of his servants . ​ — Psalm 8@@ 6 : 5 ; 1 Th@@ ess@@ alon@@ ians 5 : 17 .
God mis@@ ses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God prom@@ ises to resurrec@@ t the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
H@@ ave you ever felt hel@@ pl@@ ess when someone near to you was g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing over the l@@ os@@ s of a loved one ?
S@@ om@@ e@@ times we may feel un@@ sure of what to say or do ​ — so we w@@ ind up saying and doing nothing .
But there are practic@@ al , help@@ ful things that we can do .
O@@ f@@ ten , all that is needed is your pres@@ ence along with a simp@@ le ex@@ pression , such as “ I am so s@@ or@@ ry . ”
In many cul@@ tures , giving the person a hu@@ g or a g@@ ent@@ le s@@ qu@@ e@@ eze of the ar@@ m is an effec@@ tive way to show you care .
If the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed one wan@@ ts to talk , lis@@ ten sy@@ mp@@ a@@ the@@ tic@@ ally .
B@@ est of all , do something for the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed family , perhaps per@@ form@@ ing a cho@@ re the g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing one has not been able to care for , such as co@@ ok@@ ing a me@@ al , car@@ ing for the children , or help@@ ing with fun@@ er@@ al arr@@ ang@@ ements if that is des@@ ir@@ ed .
Such ac@@ tions may speak l@@ ou@@ d@@ er than the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the dec@@ eas@@ ed , perhaps f@@ oc@@ using on some good qual@@ ities or happy experi@@ ences .
Such con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation may even bring a sm@@ ile to the b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed person@@ ’@@ s face .
For example , P@@ am ​ — who l@@ ost her husband , I@@ an , si@@ x years ago — ​ says : “ Pe@@ ople some@@ times tell me good things that I@@ an did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers rep@@ ort that many b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed people receive a lo@@ t of in@@ iti@@ al help but that their needs are soon for@@ go@@ t@@ ten as friends get bus@@ y again with their own lives .
Th@@ er@@ efore , make a point of cont@@ ac@@ ting a b@@ er@@ e@@ av@@ ed friend on a reg@@ ular bas@@ is after the l@@ os@@ s .
* Many g@@ ri@@ ev@@ ing ones de@@ ep@@ ly appreci@@ ate this opport@@ unity to rel@@ i@@ eve themselves of pr@@ ol@@ ong@@ ed feelings of g@@ ri@@ ef .
Consider the example of K@@ a@@ or@@ i , a young Jap@@ an@@ ese woman who was dev@@ ast@@ ated by the l@@ os@@ s of her mother follow@@ ed by the l@@ os@@ s of her old@@ er sis@@ ter 15 mon@@ ths later .
Th@@ ank@@ fully , she received ong@@ o@@ ing support from loy@@ al friends .
One nam@@ ed R@@ its@@ uko is much old@@ er than K@@ a@@ or@@ i and offer@@ ed to be her close friend .
“ To be hon@@ est , ” says K@@ a@@ or@@ i , “ I was@@ n@@ ’@@ t happy about that .
I d@@ id@@ n@@ ’@@ t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I d@@ id@@ n@@ ’@@ t think that anyone could .
However , because of the way M@@ ama R@@ its@@ uko tre@@ ated me , I came to feel close to her .
E@@ very we@@ ek , we went out in the ev@@ ang@@ eliz@@ ing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She inv@@ ited me to have te@@ a with her , brought me me@@ als , and wrote me let@@ ters and car@@ ds many times .
M@@ ama R@@ its@@ uk@@ o@@ ’@@ s pos@@ iti@@ ve attitude had a good influ@@ ence on me . ”
T@@ wel@@ ve years have pass@@ ed since K@@ a@@ or@@ i@@ ’@@ s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time ev@@ ang@@ eliz@@ ers .
“ M@@ ama R@@ its@@ uko , ” K@@ a@@ or@@ i says , “ continu@@ es to show her concer@@ n .
When I go back home , I always vis@@ it her and enjoy her up@@ build@@ ing associ@@ ation . ”
A@@ no@@ ther example of someone who benef@@ ited from ong@@ o@@ ing support is P@@ ol@@ i , one of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses in C@@ y@@ pr@@ us .
P@@ ol@@ i had a kind husband , S@@ oz@@ os , who set a good example as a Christian she@@ pher@@ d by often inv@@ iting or@@ ph@@ ans and w@@ id@@ ow@@ s to their home for associ@@ ation and a me@@ al .
S@@ ad@@ ly , at the age of 5@@ 3 , S@@ oz@@ os died of a b@@ rain t@@ um@@ or .
There , they began associ@@ ating with a congregation of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” rec@@ all@@ s P@@ ol@@ i , “ did not know any@@ thing about our past and our difficult circum@@ st@@ ances .
But that did not st@@ op them from appro@@ aching us and emb@@ r@@ ac@@ ing us with their kind words and practic@@ al help .
How preci@@ ous that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation show@@ ed a great de@@ al of personal interest in Daniel .
One in par@@ tic@@ ular made sure to incl@@ ude Daniel when enjoy@@ ing associ@@ ation with friends or when going out to pl@@ ay b@@ all . ”
Bo@@ th mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can off@@ er practic@@ al help and com@@ fort to those who m@@ our@@ n .
The Bible also com@@ forts us by means of a thr@@ ill@@ ing hope for the future .
Some have even mar@@ ked the d@@ ate of the death on their cal@@ end@@ ar as a rem@@ ind@@ er to off@@ er com@@ fort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the d@@ ate of the l@@ os@@ s .
You may rec@@ all that G@@ a@@ il , mentioned ear@@ li@@ er in this ser@@ ies , doub@@ ts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , R@@ ob .
However , she is look@@ ing for@@ ward to se@@ e@@ ing him again in God@@ ’@@ s prom@@ ised new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have l@@ ost someone they love but who are not a@@ war@@ e of this hope of se@@ e@@ ing their loved one again . ”
S@@ o@@ on , God will do just that ​ — for Job and coun@@ t@@ less others — ​ when this earth is trans@@ form@@ ed into a parad@@ ise .
“ There is going to be a resurrec@@ tion , ” the Bible con@@ fir@@ ms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be amaz@@ ed at this , ” Jesus ass@@ ures us , “ for the ho@@ ur is coming in which all those in the m@@ em@@ or@@ ial t@@ omb@@ s will he@@ ar his vo@@ ice and come out . ”
He will have the pro@@ sp@@ ect of reg@@ aining “ his you@@ th@@ ful v@@ ig@@ or , ” and his fl@@ es@@ h will for@@ ever remain “ f@@ res@@ her than in you@@ th . ”
The same will happ@@ en to all who resp@@ ond with appreci@@ ation to God@@ ’@@ s m@@ erc@@ if@@ ul prov@@ ision of a resurrec@@ tion to life on earth .
If you have suffer@@ ed the l@@ os@@ s of someone de@@ ar to you , the information we have discus@@ sed may not complet@@ ely take away your g@@ ri@@ ef .
But by med@@ it@@ ating on God@@ ’@@ s prom@@ ises found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the streng@@ th to keep going . ​ — 1 Th@@ ess@@ alon@@ ians 4 : 13 .

But God ra@@ ised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus as@@ c@@ ended to heaven .
This ex@@ tr@@ a@@ ord@@ in@@ ary account comes to us from the four G@@ os@@ p@@ els of the Christian Greek Scriptures , comm@@ only called the New T@@ est@@ am@@ ent .
On the other hand , if those ev@@ ents really did happ@@ en , then there is a br@@ ight future for mankind , one in which you can share .
So , are the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l acc@@ oun@@ ts fact or fic@@ tion ?
Un@@ like f@@ anc@@ if@@ ul leg@@ ends , the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ings refl@@ ect p@@ ain@@ st@@ aking acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y and attention to det@@ a@@ il .
For example , they ab@@ ound with nam@@ es of real plac@@ es , many of which can be vis@@ ited today .
They tell about real people , who@@ se ex@@ ist@@ ence has been cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated by sec@@ ular his@@ tor@@ ians . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by sec@@ ular writ@@ ers of the first and second centur@@ ies .
* His man@@ ner of death , as describ@@ ed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , ag@@ re@@ es with Rom@@ an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ti@@ onal m@@ eth@@ od@@ s of the time .
Mor@@ e@@ over , ev@@ ents are rel@@ ated in a fac@@ t@@ ual and c@@ and@@ id man@@ ner ​ — even por@@ tr@@ aying some of Jesus ’ disciples un@@ fav@@ or@@ ab@@ ly .
All these fac@@ tors str@@ ong@@ ly indic@@ ate that the G@@ os@@ pe@@ l writ@@ ers were hon@@ est and acc@@ ur@@ ate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is gener@@ ally accep@@ ted that Jesus liv@@ ed and died , some would question his resurrec@@ tion .
Even his apost@@ les did not believe the in@@ iti@@ al rep@@ ort of his having re@@ turned to life .
All doub@@ t was rem@@ ov@@ ed , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrec@@ ted Jesus on se@@ par@@ ate occas@@ ions .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 5@@ 00 ey@@ ew@@ itnes@@ ses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the ris@@ k of being ar@@ res@@ ted and k@@ ill@@ ed , the disciples cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ously pro@@ claim@@ ed Jesus ’ resurrec@@ tion to all ​ — even to the very ones who had ex@@ ec@@ uted him .
W@@ ould so many disciples have been so b@@ old if they were not ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely sure that Jesus had really been resurrec@@ ted ?
In fact , the re@@ ality of the resurrec@@ tion of Jesus is the dr@@ iving for@@ ce be@@ h@@ ind the imp@@ act that Christi@@ an@@ ity has had on the world both then and now .
The G@@ os@@ pe@@ l acc@@ oun@@ ts of Jesus ’ death and resurrec@@ tion be@@ ar all the necess@@ ary mar@@ ks of an auth@@ enti@@ c his@@ tor@@ ical rec@@ ord .
C@@ ar@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly reading them will conv@@ in@@ ce you that these ev@@ ents really happ@@ ened .
Your conv@@ ic@@ tion can be fur@@ ther streng@@ th@@ ened when you understand why they took place .
T@@ ac@@ it@@ us , born about 5@@ 5 C.E . , wrote that “ Chris@@ t@@ us , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its orig@@ in , suffer@@ ed the ext@@ re@@ me p@@ en@@ al@@ ty during the re@@ ign of T@@ ib@@ er@@ i@@ us at the h@@ ands of one of our pro@@ cur@@ at@@ ors , P@@ on@@ ti@@ us P@@ il@@ at@@ us . ”
Jesus is also refer@@ red to by S@@ u@@ et@@ on@@ i@@ us ( first century ) ; Jewish his@@ tor@@ ian Jos@@ eph@@ us ( first century ) ; and P@@ lin@@ y the Y@@ ou@@ ng@@ er , govern@@ or of B@@ ith@@ y@@ n@@ ia ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is un@@ likely that Jesus ’ many op@@ pos@@ ers would writ@@ e any@@ thing that would l@@ end cre@@ d@@ ib@@ ility to the rep@@ orts about him .
R@@ eg@@ arding Jesus ’ resurrec@@ tion , Peter , one of his apost@@ les , expl@@ ained : “ God ra@@ ised this one up on the th@@ ir@@ d day and al@@ low@@ ed him to become man@@ if@@ est , not to all the people , but to witnes@@ ses appo@@ inted be@@ for@@ e@@ hand by God , to us , who ate and dr@@ an@@ k with him after his ris@@ ing from the dead . ”
Matthe@@ w@@ ’@@ s G@@ os@@ pe@@ l t@@ ells us that when the religious enem@@ ies heard rep@@ orts of Jesus ’ resurrec@@ tion , they s@@ ch@@ em@@ ed to su@@ p@@ pr@@ ess them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrec@@ tion to be k@@ ept sec@@ re@@ t ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He ord@@ ered us to pre@@ ach to the people and to give a th@@ or@@ ough witnes@@ s that this is the one dec@@ re@@ ed by God to be jud@@ ge of the living and the dead . ”
Tr@@ ue Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin ent@@ ered into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live for@@ ever ? ”
M@@ ost people would pro@@ bab@@ ly say that they want to but that they feel it is un@@ re@@ alis@@ tic to consider it .
De@@ ath is a nor@@ m@@ al part of life , they say , the natur@@ al out@@ come of our ex@@ ist@@ ence .
S@@ u@@ pp@@ ose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to di@@ e ? ”
U@@ nd@@ er nor@@ m@@ al circum@@ st@@ ances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God cre@@ ated humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put et@@ ern@@ ity in their heart . ” ​ — Ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ ast@@ es 3 : 11 .
The re@@ ality , though , is that humans do not live for@@ ever .
F@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , has God done any@@ thing to rem@@ ed@@ y the situation ?
The Bib@@ le@@ ’@@ s answ@@ ers are hear@@ t@@ ening , and they have a direc@@ t be@@ ar@@ ing on why Jesus suffer@@ ed and died .
The first three chap@@ ters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human cou@@ ple , Adam and E@@ ve , the pro@@ sp@@ ect of un@@ ending life and told them what they would have to do to g@@ ain it .
Then the account describ@@ es how they fail@@ ed to obe@@ y God and l@@ ost that pro@@ sp@@ ect .
The st@@ ory is told simply ​ — so simply that some are qu@@ ic@@ k to dis@@ mis@@ s it as fol@@ k@@ l@@ or@@ e .
But Genesis , like the G@@ os@@ p@@ els , gives every ind@@ ication of being a fac@@ t@@ ual , his@@ tor@@ ical rec@@ ord .
What has been the result of Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s fail@@ ure to obe@@ y ?
The Bible answ@@ ers this way : “ Th@@ r@@ ough one man [ Adam ] sin ent@@ ered into the world and death through sin , and so death sp@@ read to all men because they had all sin@@ ned . ”
He thus l@@ ost the pro@@ sp@@ ect of end@@ less life and ev@@ ent@@ ually died .
Be@@ ing his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , we have in@@ her@@ ited his sin@@ ful con@@ dition .
But has God done any@@ thing to rem@@ ed@@ y the situation ?
Yes , God made arr@@ ang@@ ements to re@@ de@@ em , or bu@@ y back , what Adam had l@@ ost for his des@@ c@@ end@@ ants , nam@@ ely , the pro@@ sp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
“ The wa@@ g@@ es sin p@@ ays is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of sin .
L@@ ik@@ ew@@ ise , we sin and are ther@@ efore sub@@ ject to sin@@ ’@@ s wa@@ g@@ es , death .
But we were born in this sin@@ ful con@@ dition through no fa@@ ult of our own .
So God lov@@ ingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accep@@ t ‘ the wa@@ g@@ es of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death op@@ ens the way to a happy , end@@ less life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through dis@@ obedi@@ ence , a perfect man obedi@@ ent even t@@ ill death was needed to rel@@ ease us from that bur@@ den .
The Bible expl@@ ains it this way : “ J@@ ust as through the dis@@ obedi@@ ence of the one man many were made sin@@ n@@ ers , so also through the obedi@@ ence of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our be@@ half .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with God and g@@ ain the pro@@ sp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
Why , though , was it necess@@ ary for Jesus to di@@ e to ac@@ compl@@ ish this ?
C@@ ould not Al@@ m@@ igh@@ ty God have simply issu@@ ed a dec@@ ree that Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s des@@ c@@ end@@ ants be al@@ low@@ ed to live for@@ ever ?
H@@ ad God set jus@@ tice as@@ ide in this inst@@ ance , people might have wond@@ ered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fa@@ ir in determin@@ ing who among Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s off@@ s@@ pr@@ ing qual@@ if@@ y for et@@ ern@@ al life ?
C@@ ould he be tr@@ us@@ ted to keep his prom@@ ises ?
God@@ ’@@ s ad@@ her@@ ence to jus@@ tice in wor@@ king out our sal@@ v@@ ation is ass@@ ur@@ ance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacrif@@ ic@@ ial death , God op@@ ened the way to end@@ less life in Parad@@ ise on earth .
N@@ ote Jesus ’ words as rec@@ ord@@ ed at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - be@@ go@@ t@@ ten Son , so that every@@ one exerc@@ is@@ ing faith in him might not be des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an ex@@ pression not only of God@@ ’@@ s un@@ fail@@ ing jus@@ tice but , more spec@@ ially , of his great love for humans .
However , why did Jesus have to suf@@ fer and di@@ e in the p@@ ain@@ ful way that was describ@@ ed in the G@@ os@@ p@@ els ?
By sub@@ jec@@ ting himself to the ext@@ re@@ me t@@ est and rem@@ aining faithful , Jesus ref@@ uted once and for all the D@@ ev@@ il@@ ’@@ s cla@@ im that humans would not remain loy@@ al to God when under tr@@ ial .
That cla@@ im might have se@@ em@@ ed val@@ id after Satan ind@@ uc@@ ed perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s perfect equ@@ iv@@ al@@ ent — ​ rem@@ ained obedi@@ ent des@@ pite s@@ ev@@ ere suffering .
He thus proved that Adam too could have ob@@ ey@@ ed God if he had c@@ hos@@ en to do so .
By end@@ uring under tr@@ ial , Jesus left us a mod@@ el to follow .
God re@@ war@@ d@@ ed his S@@ on@@ ’@@ s perfect obedi@@ ence , gr@@ an@@ ting Jesus im@@ mor@@ t@@ al life in heaven .
Jesus indic@@ ated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

[ 1 ] ( par@@ ag@@ r@@ ap@@ h 14 ) See chap@@ ter 21 of the book God@@ ’@@ s Kingdom R@@ ul@@ es !
During an ass@@ emb@@ ly , a brother asked me if I would like to pre@@ ach .
We went to the ter@@ rit@@ ory , and he gave me some bo@@ ok@@ l@@ ets about God@@ ’@@ s Kingdom .
One of the sis@@ ters there gave us children Bible less@@ ons based on the Bible and the book The H@@ ar@@ p of God .
As a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , I enjoy@@ ed giving people hope from God@@ ’@@ s Word .
The brother st@@ opp@@ ed his b@@ ic@@ y@@ c@@ le and asked me to s@@ it down with him on a lo@@ g .
He said : “ Who gave you author@@ ity to jud@@ ge who is a go@@ at ?
L@@ et@@ ’@@ s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the judg@@ ing to Jehovah . ”
A@@ no@@ ther old@@ er brother taught me that to find happ@@ iness in giving , we some@@ times have to end@@ ure pati@@ ently .
Y@@ ears later , his pati@@ ence was re@@ war@@ d@@ ed when his wife was baptized as one of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
After the war , I pione@@ ered for two years in sou@@ ther@@ n I@@ rel@@ and .
We did not real@@ ize how much power the pri@@ ests had .
I had never sa@@ il@@ ed before , so I was exc@@ ited .
For f@@ ive years , we pre@@ ached m@@ ainly on is@@ ol@@ ated is@@ lands where there were no Witnesses .

O@@ f@@ ten , they gave us f@@ res@@ h f@@ ish , av@@ oc@@ ad@@ os , and pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
Then at d@@ us@@ k we r@@ an@@ g the shi@@ p@@ ’@@ s bel@@ l .
It was lov@@ ely to see how ser@@ i@@ ously some of them took their ass@@ ign@@ ment .
When we arr@@ ived , I m@@ et and fel@@ l in love with M@@ ax@@ ine B@@ oy@@ d , a be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful mission@@ ary sis@@ ter .
So I said to my@@ self , ‘ R@@ on@@ al@@ d , if you want this gir@@ l , you@@ ’@@ ve go@@ t to act qu@@ ick@@ ly . ’
After three we@@ ek@@ s I pro@@ posed , and after si@@ x we@@ ek@@ s we were married .
M@@ ax@@ ine and I were ass@@ igned as mission@@ ar@@ ies to P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o , so I never went out on the new bo@@ at .
For example , in the v@@ ill@@ age of P@@ ot@@ ala P@@ ast@@ il@@ lo , there were two Witnes@@ s famil@@ ies with many children , and I used to pl@@ ay the fl@@ ute for them .
I asked one of the little gir@@ ls , H@@ ild@@ a , if she wanted to come and pre@@ ach with us .
We b@@ ought her a p@@ a@@ ir , and she came preaching with us .
She was about to leave for her ass@@ ign@@ ment in Ec@@ u@@ ad@@ or , and she said : “ You d@@ on@@ ’@@ t recogn@@ ize me , do you ?
I am the little gir@@ l from P@@ ast@@ il@@ lo who had no sho@@ es . ”
At first , L@@ en@@ n@@ ar@@ t Joh@@ n@@ son and I did most of the work .
N@@ ath@@ an K@@ nor@@ r , who was then taking the lead among Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , came to P@@ u@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o .

This has done wond@@ ers for her faith in God and in the Bible . ”
The first article shows how our faith can gro@@ w and remain strong .
Let me expl@@ ain what led to that con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation .
I W@@ A@@ S born in W@@ ich@@ it@@ a , K@@ ans@@ as , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A . , on D@@ ec@@ ember 10 , 19@@ 36 , the old@@ est of four children .
Then a sol@@ di@@ er wal@@ ked by , and the doc@@ tor y@@ el@@ led , “ Do something about this y@@ el@@ low co@@ ward ! ”
The sol@@ di@@ er could see that the man was dr@@ un@@ k , so he told him , “ G@@ o home and s@@ ob@@ er up ! ”
He ow@@ ned two b@@ ar@@ b@@ er@@ sho@@ ps in W@@ ich@@ it@@ a , and the doc@@ tor was one of his c@@ li@@ ents !
With my parents , going to a conv@@ ention in W@@ ich@@ it@@ a in the 19@@ 40 ’ s
With Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s bless@@ ing and their ze@@ al@@ ous work , a congregation was started .
The brother also s@@ old my c@@ ar for $ 25 .
We were ass@@ igned to special pione@@ er in W@@ al@@ n@@ ut R@@ id@@ ge , Ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as .
Then in 19@@ 6@@ 2 , we were thr@@ ill@@ ed to receive an inv@@ it@@ ation to the 3@@ 7@@ th cl@@ ass of Gil@@ ead .
In the ministry in N@@ a@@ i@@ ro@@ bi with M@@ ary and Ch@@ r@@ is K@@ an@@ a@@ iya
S@@ o@@ on after , our first daugh@@ ter , K@@ imb@@ er@@ ly , was born , and 17 mon@@ ths later , we had St@@ eph@@ any .
We would also go c@@ amp@@ ing with them and would have very enjoy@@ able con@@ ver@@ s@@ ations around the c@@ amp@@ fir@@ e .
We arr@@ ang@@ ed to have some who were in the full - time ministry st@@ ay in our home .
They were sho@@ c@@ ked and started to cr@@ y and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direc@@ tion of God@@ ’@@ s organization , we did our best to ra@@ ise them to love Jehovah .
On a later tri@@ p , K@@ imb@@ er@@ ly m@@ et one of his work@@ m@@ ates , B@@ ri@@ an L@@ le@@ wel@@ ly@@ n .
So they did st@@ ay free until they were at le@@ ast 23 .
At the same time , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ imb@@ er@@ ly were inv@@ ited to work at L@@ ond@@ on Be@@ the@@ l and later were trans@@ fer@@ red to M@@ al@@ aw@@ i Be@@ the@@ l .
The day after we left for the Watchtower E@@ duc@@ ational C@@ ent@@ er in P@@ at@@ ter@@ son , L@@ inda called to tell us that M@@ other had died .
N@@ ext , we taught the course in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we and then in Z@@ amb@@ ia .
In 200@@ 6 , B@@ ri@@ an and K@@ imb@@ er@@ ly moved next do@@ or to us to ra@@ ise their two daugh@@ ters , M@@ ac@@ k@@ enz@@ ie and El@@ iz@@ ab@@ et@@ h .
Paul and St@@ eph@@ any are still in M@@ al@@ aw@@ i , where Paul serv@@ es on the Br@@ an@@ ch Com@@ mit@@ te@@ e .
Why might we need to ad@@ just our view of str@@ ang@@ ers ?

My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was lear@@ ning .
However , I was cur@@ ious and asked questions , so she stud@@ ied with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too dec@@ ided that I wanted to ded@@ ic@@ ate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the serv@@ ant to the bre@@ th@@ ren ( now called a circ@@ u@@ it over@@ se@@ er ) .
He said , “ G@@ o for it ! ”
After four mon@@ ths , I sel@@ ec@@ ted a brother as my pione@@ er par@@ t@@ ner .

Jesus show@@ ed that his disciples would be re@@ war@@ d@@ ed for their sacrif@@ ices ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ ap@@ h 5 )
The apostle Peter once asked Jesus : “ We have left all things and follow@@ ed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
In the S@@ er@@ m@@ on on the M@@ ount , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ j@@ oy@@ ed , since your re@@ ward is great in the heav@@ ens , for in that way they pers@@ ec@@ uted the proph@@ ets pri@@ or to you . ”

Wh@@ en@@ ever I make personal sacrif@@ ices for him , he gives me back a h@@ und@@ re@@ d@@ f@@ old in bless@@ ings . ”
For my own encour@@ ag@@ ement , I keep a no@@ t@@ eb@@ o@@ ok with sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures and th@@ oug@@ h@@ ts from our pub@@ lic@@ ations that I can cons@@ ult from time to time .

They need to sense Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s love and comp@@ as@@ sion among their fellow Christians .
Many of t@@ od@@ ay@@ ’@@ s ref@@ ug@@ e@@ es come from countries where our preaching work is res@@ tr@@ ic@@ ted .
She said : “ The brothers there tre@@ ated them like close relati@@ ves , prov@@ id@@ ing food , clo@@ th@@ es , s@@ hel@@ ter , and tr@@ an@@ sp@@ ort@@ ation .

3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not exp@@ ect of their children ?
When your children see you “ se@@ ek@@ ing first the Kingdom , ” they learn to dep@@ end on Jehovah for their d@@ a@@ ily needs .
N@@ ever get so bus@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from lear@@ ning your language ?
Par@@ ents , if that describ@@ es your children , can you learn at le@@ ast some of the loc@@ al language ?
A child who commun@@ ic@@ ates best in another sp@@ ok@@ en language des@@ er@@ ves the same concer@@ n , would you not ag@@ ree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her stud@@ ying , pray@@ ing , and doing her best to conduct family worship every we@@ ek , we under@@ st@@ ood that g@@ etting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two langu@@ ages ?
( a ) Who must dec@@ ide which language congregation to att@@ end ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( Read 1 Corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
The answer was not what we person@@ ally found conv@@ en@@ i@@ ent .
But when we saw that they were g@@ etting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we dec@@ ided to m@@ ove to the loc@@ al - language congregation .
T@@ og@@ ether , we reg@@ ularly att@@ ended meetings and shar@@ ed in the ministry .
We also inv@@ ited loc@@ al friends to jo@@ in us for me@@ als and ex@@ cur@@ si@@ ons .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and F@@ ri@@ end .
We consid@@ ered this to be much more important than their mas@@ ter@@ ing our language . ”
Samuel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritu@@ ally strong , my wife and I also att@@ ended meetings in our language .
L@@ ife was very bus@@ y , and we were ti@@ red .
But we th@@ an@@ k Jehovah for bless@@ ing our ef@@ forts and sacrif@@ ices .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ I knew the bas@@ ic@@ s of my parents ’ language , but the language sp@@ ok@@ en at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ all@@ s Kris@@ t@@ ina .
“ When I was 12 , I att@@ ended a conv@@ ention in my school language .
For the first time , I under@@ st@@ ood that what I was hear@@ ing was the truth !
A@@ no@@ ther tur@@ ning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Y@@ oun@@ g people , do you think that you would pre@@ fer being part of a loc@@ al - language congregation ?
“ When my sib@@ l@@ ings and I go@@ t into our te@@ ens , we wanted to s@@ w@@ it@@ ch to the loc@@ al - language congregation , ” says N@@ ad@@ ia , who now serv@@ es at Be@@ the@@ l .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re gr@@ at@@ eful that our parents wor@@ ked hard to teach us their language and k@@ ept us in the for@@ e@@ ign - language congregation .
It has en@@ ric@@ h@@ ed our lives and bro@@ ad@@ ened our opport@@ un@@ ities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
St@@ ill , parents who do not know the loc@@ al language may need help to re@@ ach their ch@@ ild@@ r@@ en@@ ’@@ s heart .
Bo@@ th children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ aph@@ s 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with stud@@ ent talk ass@@ ign@@ ments for the meet@@ ing , I always learned more .
And I enjoy@@ ed the le@@ is@@ ure activ@@ ities we shar@@ ed in as a group . ”
Par@@ ents , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .

By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among your@@ selves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apostle John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”

“ Jehovah f@@ ind@@ s pleas@@ ure in those who fear him , in those wa@@ iting for his loy@@ al love . ”
15 - 17 . ( a ) How might we at times feel about our tri@@ als , but how does Jehovah use his Word to help us ?
Today , Jehovah gu@@ ides us with his Word , the Bible .
( Read Psalm 14@@ 7 : 19 , 20 . )
What pl@@ ans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pione@@ er service lead to ?
Y@@ O@@ U young ones will pro@@ bab@@ ly ag@@ ree that before star@@ ting a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , it is wise to pl@@ an where you will go .
L@@ ife is like a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y , and the time to pl@@ an where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wan@@ ts you to pl@@ an for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his im@@ age . ”
You will be happy when you im@@ itate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also d@@ re@@ w close to Jehovah by stud@@ ying the Scriptures .
“ P@@ l@@ ans fa@@ il when there is no cons@@ ul@@ t@@ ation , but there is ac@@ compl@@ ish@@ ment through many ad@@ vis@@ ers . ”
As with any car@@ e@@ er , you need time to become sk@@ ill@@ ed .
At first , I co@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t star@@ t any Bible stud@@ ies , but later I moved to another ter@@ rit@@ ory , and with@@ in a mon@@ th I started sever@@ al stud@@ ies .
One stud@@ ent began coming to the Kingdom H@@ all .
For example , J@@ ac@@ ob , from N@@ or@@ th Amer@@ ica , writ@@ es : “ When I was s@@ even , many of my cl@@ ass@@ m@@ ates were V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made pl@@ ans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by com@@ par@@ ing the Eng@@ lish and V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese ed@@ itions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a ne@@ ar@@ by V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pione@@ ering .
L@@ ater , I att@@ ended the Bible S@@ cho@@ ol for S@@ ing@@ le Bro@@ thers .
This helped me with my present pione@@ er ass@@ ign@@ ment , where I am the only eld@@ er in a V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese - language group .
Many V@@ i@@ et@@ nam@@ ese people are amaz@@ ed that I have learned their language .
They inv@@ ite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have pro@@ g@@ res@@ sed to bap@@ t@@ ism . ” ​ — Com@@ pare Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encour@@ ag@@ ing the young brothers in our congregation and se@@ e@@ ing their spiritual pro@@ g@@ ress .
After I att@@ ended the Bible S@@ cho@@ ol for S@@ ing@@ le Bro@@ thers , I received a new pione@@ er ass@@ ign@@ ment .
I@@ t@@ ’@@ s true that I have never found anyone in the ter@@ rit@@ ory who pro@@ g@@ res@@ sed to bap@@ t@@ ism , but others have .
How may pione@@ er service lead to other opport@@ un@@ ities ?
A brother nam@@ ed K@@ ev@@ in says : “ Ev@@ er since I was a little bo@@ y , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time som@@ ed@@ ay .
F@@ in@@ ally , I started pione@@ ering when I was 19 .
I supp@@ or@@ ted my@@ self wor@@ king part - time for a brother who was a build@@ er .
I learned to inst@@ all ro@@ of@@ s , w@@ ind@@ ow@@ s , and do@@ ors .
L@@ ater , I sp@@ ent two years with a h@@ ur@@ ric@@ ane rel@@ i@@ ef te@@ am , re@@ build@@ ing Kingdom H@@ all@@ s and hom@@ es for the brothers .
When I heard about the con@@ struc@@ tion needs in S@@ outh Afr@@ ica , I appl@@ ied and was inv@@ ited to go .
H@@ ere in Afr@@ ica , I m@@ ove from one Kingdom H@@ all pro@@ ject to another every few we@@ ek@@ s .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
I also enjoy preaching with the loc@@ al brothers each we@@ ek .
The pl@@ ans I made as a bo@@ y have made me happy in ways I did not for@@ es@@ e@@ e . ”
Be@@ the@@ l service is a happy way of life because every@@ thing you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was inv@@ ited to Be@@ the@@ l , where I learned to oper@@ ate pr@@ int@@ ing press@@ es and later to do comp@@ u@@ ter pro@@ gr@@ am@@ m@@ ing .
At Be@@ the@@ l , I enjoy hear@@ ing fir@@ s@@ th@@ and about the pro@@ g@@ ress of the disci@@ ple - making activ@@ ity world@@ wide .
I love serving here because what we do hel@@ ps people to d@@ ra@@ w close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wan@@ ts you to “ get a fir@@ m hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
Then pl@@ an to do what is pleas@@ ing to him .
He has stud@@ ied human be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or since man was cre@@ ated .
I@@ t@@ ’@@ s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who k@@ ill the body and after this are not able to do any@@ thing more . ”
Do not be struc@@ k with ter@@ ro@@ r or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you wh@@ er@@ ever you go . ”
L@@ is@@ ten to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The second article hig@@ hl@@ igh@@ ts how Jehovah can do the un@@ expec@@ ted by ac@@ compl@@ ish@@ ing things we could never im@@ ag@@ ine .
L@@ ike the f@@ arm@@ er , we need to wa@@ it pati@@ ently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet M@@ ic@@ ah ?
( Read M@@ ic@@ ah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of M@@ ic@@ ah , we will be will@@ ing to wa@@ it for Jehovah .
So we “ end@@ ure fully with pati@@ ence and joy . ”
Abraham had to wa@@ it many years before his gr@@ and@@ sons E@@ sa@@ u and J@@ ac@@ ob were born ( See par@@ ag@@ r@@ aph@@ s 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
But just im@@ ag@@ ine Abra@@ ham@@ ’@@ s joy when he is resurrec@@ ted back to a parad@@ ise earth .
Although you me@@ ant to har@@ m me , God int@@ ended it to turn out well and to pres@@ er@@ ve many people al@@ ive , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
I will sing to Jehovah , for he has ric@@ hly re@@ war@@ d@@ ed me . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be will@@ ing to wa@@ it pati@@ ently ?
What less@@ ons do we learn from what happ@@ ened to the apostle Paul in Philipp@@ i ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
S@@ o@@ on after he arr@@ ived in M@@ ac@@ ed@@ on@@ ia , he ended up in pris@@ on !
Why did Jehovah al@@ low this to happ@@ en to Paul ?
Bo@@ th he and S@@ il@@ as started “ pray@@ ing and pra@@ is@@ ing God with s@@ ong . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did P@@ a@@ ul@@ ’@@ s situation change un@@ expec@@ t@@ ed@@ ly ?
What will we now discus@@ s and re@@ view together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
S@@ om@@ e@@ times he sur@@ pris@@ es us by doing the un@@ expec@@ ted .
Jehovah sent an angel to des@@ tro@@ y 18@@ 5@@ ,000 of S@@ en@@ n@@ ach@@ er@@ ib@@ ’@@ s sol@@ di@@ ers in one night .
( a ) What less@@ on do we learn from what happ@@ ened to Jos@@ ep@@ h ?
No doub@@ t Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s ac@@ tions exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ed all of Jos@@ eph@@ ’@@ s expec@@ t@@ ations .
Th@@ ink , too , about Jos@@ eph@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ mother S@@ ar@@ ah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah car@@ es for us and wan@@ ts us to succ@@ eed .
How can we str@@ i@@ p off and keep off the old person@@ ality ?
By 19@@ 39 there were 6@@ ,000 of them in the [ conc@@ entr@@ ation c@@ amp@@ s ] . ”
And you people have cle@@ an@@ ed the st@@ ad@@ i@@ um so n@@ ic@@ ely .
But most of all , you are truly m@@ ul@@ ti@@ r@@ ac@@ ial . ”
But the more I had sex@@ ual rel@@ ations , the more in@@ sec@@ ure I felt . ”
This way of life continu@@ ed until S@@ aku@@ ra was 23 years old .
It go@@ t so bad that I could not wa@@ it for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could wat@@ ch por@@ no@@ gr@@ aph@@ ic v@@ id@@ e@@ os . ”
What helped St@@ eph@@ en to put away anger and ab@@ us@@ ive spe@@ ec@@ h ?
He says : “ Our family life im@@ proved dr@@ ama@@ tic@@ ally .
Today , St@@ eph@@ en serv@@ es as a minis@@ ter@@ ial serv@@ ant , and his wife has been a reg@@ ular pione@@ er for sever@@ al years .
Bible t@@ ex@@ ts that encour@@ aged me were Isaiah 5@@ 5 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had ab@@ and@@ oned sin@@ ful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah pati@@ ently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new person@@ ality . ”
We also benefit from God@@ ’@@ s Word and his holy spirit when we pre@@ pare for and att@@ end congregation meetings .
See chap@@ ter 25 in the book Q@@ u@@ es@@ tions Y@@ oun@@ g Pe@@ ople As@@ k ​ — An@@ s@@ w@@ ers That Wor@@ k , V@@ ol@@ ume 1 .

When we show@@ ed them sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tures from their P@@ ort@@ ug@@ u@@ ese Bible , such as Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or Psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they p@@ a@@ id attention and some@@ times even sh@@ ed t@@ ears . ”
We are so th@@ ank@@ ful to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
What example did Jesus set in show@@ ing m@@ ild@@ ness and pati@@ ence ?
J@@ ust as Jehovah fre@@ ely for@@ gave you , you must also do the same . ”
Then he add@@ ed : “ If you continue show@@ ing fav@@ or@@ it@@ ism , you are comm@@ it@@ ting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
L@@ ove is also “ pati@@ ent and kind ” and “ does not get p@@ uf@@ f@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a pro@@ p@@ iti@@ at@@ ory sacrifice for our sin@@ s . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love gre@@ ater than this , that someone should sur@@ r@@ end@@ er his life in be@@ half of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ L@@ it@@ tle children , we should love , not in word or with the t@@ ong@@ ue , but in de@@ ed and truth . ”
But then I asked my@@ self , ‘ How can I im@@ itate Jesus in de@@ al@@ ing with this person ? ’
After refl@@ ec@@ ting on what Jesus would have done , I dec@@ ided to let the matter go and not make an issu@@ e of it .
L@@ ater , I learned that my co@@ work@@ er had been cop@@ ing with a ser@@ ious health problem and was under a lo@@ t of str@@ ess .
I concl@@ ud@@ ed that she pro@@ bab@@ ly did not really mean what she wrote .
R@@ ef@@ l@@ ec@@ ting on Jesus ’ example of show@@ ing love even when prov@@ ok@@ ed helped me to show similar love to my co@@ work@@ er . ”
By le@@ aving heaven , “ he emp@@ ti@@ ed himself ” in our be@@ half , even “ to the point of death . ”
P@@ E@@ A@@ C@@ E : “ P@@ ut@@ ting up with one another in love ” al@@ lo@@ ws us to enjoy “ the un@@ iting b@@ ond of peace . ”
W@@ ould you not ag@@ ree that such a pe@@ ac@@ eful spirit is truly un@@ iq@@ ue in t@@ od@@ ay@@ ’@@ s div@@ ided world ?
Paul wrote : “ L@@ ove build@@ s up . ”
The following day , they had out@@ grow@@ n the v@@ en@@ ue . ”
B@@ el@@ ow the pic@@ ture was the cap@@ tion : “ In@@ v@@ as@@ ion of the st@@ re@@ ets . ”
One congregation wrote , “ The only l@@ ine that p@@ as@@ ses near this place is a t@@ el@@ e@@ gr@@ ap@@ h l@@ ine . ”

How can you help your children to devel@@ op self - control ?
( Read Ex@@ odus 34 : 5 - 7 . )
( b ) Why should you be inter@@ ested in what the Bible says about comp@@ as@@ sion ?
( a ) Why did Jehovah s@@ end ang@@ els to S@@ od@@ om ?
( Read Ex@@ odus 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their for@@ ef@@ ath@@ ers k@@ ept war@@ ning them by means of his mess@@ eng@@ ers , war@@ ning them again and again , because he felt comp@@ as@@ sion for his people and for his d@@ wel@@ ling place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”
In@@ st@@ ead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
One mean@@ ing of comp@@ as@@ sion is “ to suf@@ fer together . ”
“ Be cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous and strong and go to work .
How can young ones and their parents show cour@@ age ?

How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents exp@@ end much ef@@ fort and res@@ our@@ c@@ es help@@ ing their children re@@ ach go@@ als in such ar@@ eas as sp@@ orts , rec@@ re@@ ation , and educ@@ ation .
It makes so much more sense to exp@@ end ef@@ fort and res@@ our@@ c@@ es in help@@ ing our children re@@ ach go@@ als that will help them to maint@@ ain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great s@@ ource of satis@@ fac@@ tion not only to see our children re@@ ach spiritual go@@ als but to share the j@@ our@@ ne@@ y with them . ”
G@@ ive exam@@ ples of cour@@ age in the Christian congregation .
( a ) How can baptized brothers be cour@@ ag@@ e@@ ous ?

During a talk at the Kingdom H@@ all . . . , the spe@@ ak@@ er refer@@ red to James 1 : 23 , 24 .
“ A few days later , I read a sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ture that chang@@ ed my life .

I know you , I know your sin@@ s , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was un@@ able to s@@ le@@ ep that night .

Your S@@ on@@ ’@@ s sacrifice is not en@@ ough to c@@ over me . ’

We are the only Witnesses they are ex@@ posed to .

How can we avoid becom@@ ing lov@@ ers of money ?
It means that they do not love God at all . ”
How can we avoid becom@@ ing lov@@ ers of pleas@@ ures ?
We also know that love “ does not b@@ ra@@ g , does not get p@@ uf@@ f@@ ed up . ”

So ask yourself , ‘ Do I know Jehovah as well as No@@ ah , Daniel , and Job did ? ’
No@@ ah@@ ’@@ s great - gr@@ and@@ father E@@ no@@ ch also “ k@@ ept wal@@ king with the true God . ”
Jesus said : “ Abraham your father re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed great@@ ly at the pro@@ sp@@ ect of se@@ e@@ ing my day . ”

M@@ aking chang@@ es was not eas@@ y , but I became happ@@ i@@ er and found real purpose in life . ”
So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
They said : “ We are witnes@@ ses of all the things he did . ”
How will having the mind of Christ af@@ fect your d@@ a@@ ily life ?
He says : “ I never did any@@ thing wrong , but I was just going through the mo@@ tions .
I look@@ ed spiritu@@ ally strong , being at all the meetings and serving as an a@@ ux@@ il@@ i@@ ary pione@@ er a few times a year .

I was born in a one - ro@@ om lo@@ g c@@ ab@@ in in a very small t@@ own called L@@ ib@@ er@@ ty , Ind@@ i@@ ana , U@@ .@@ S@@ .@@ A .
L@@ ater , my mother gave bir@@ th to my two you@@ ng@@ er brothers and my you@@ ng@@ er sis@@ ter .
D@@ U@@ R@@ IN@@ G my school years , not much chang@@ ed .
The t@@ own of L@@ ib@@ er@@ ty was sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed by small f@@ ar@@ ms , and the bas@@ ic c@@ ro@@ p was cor@@ n .
She took us to the B@@ ap@@ t@@ ist ch@@ urch every S@@ und@@ ay .
They wanted me to make the mil@@ it@@ ary my car@@ e@@ er .
This time , however , they inv@@ ited me to come to a C@@ ong@@ reg@@ ation Bo@@ ok St@@ ud@@ y , a small meet@@ ing for Bible study and discus@@ sion that was hel@@ d in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I co@@ ul@@ d@@ n@@ ’@@ t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Y@@ ears before , when I asked my mother about Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , she simply said , “ O@@ h , they worship some old man nam@@ ed Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being op@@ ened !
I started pione@@ ering the next year , in 195@@ 8 .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia was a j@@ ew@@ el then , and she is a j@@ ew@@ el today .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia and I go@@ t married in F@@ eb@@ ru@@ ary of 195@@ 9 .
A de@@ ar brother , S@@ im@@ on K@@ r@@ ak@@ er , inter@@ view@@ ed us .
He told us that Be@@ the@@ l was not accep@@ ting married cou@@ ples at that time .
M@@ ost of our j@@ ob@@ s p@@ a@@ id three d@@ ol@@ lar@@ s a day .
E@@ ach we@@ ek , G@@ l@@ or@@ ia did ir@@ on@@ ing for one family .
I rem@@ ember one time when we st@@ opp@@ ed at a g@@ as st@@ ation .
On the other hand , we had wond@@ erful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
M@@ e@@ an@@ while , I started a study with the cou@@ ple@@ ’@@ s daugh@@ ter and her husband .
M@@ other and daugh@@ ter both dec@@ ided to serve Jehovah and go@@ t baptized .
We had de@@ ar friends in the wh@@ ite congregation .
The K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x K@@ l@@ an ( K@@ K@@ K ) , an organization that prom@@ ot@@ es r@@ ac@@ ism and viol@@ ence , was very ac@@ tive then .
In 19@@ 6@@ 2 , I was inv@@ ited to att@@ end the Kingdom M@@ inis@@ try S@@ cho@@ ol at S@@ outh L@@ ans@@ ing , New York .
However , a t@@ el@@ eph@@ one comp@@ any in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ uf@@ f had inter@@ view@@ ed me for a jo@@ b .
If they hi@@ red me , I would be the first bl@@ ack man to work for that comp@@ any .
I had no money to trav@@ el to New York .
She said , “ G@@ o to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
I am so gl@@ ad that I did not take that jo@@ b !
H@@ ere is how G@@ l@@ or@@ ia rem@@ embers our time in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ uf@@ f : “ I fel@@ l in love with the ter@@ rit@@ ory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the mor@@ ning and then conduct Bible stud@@ ies the res@@ t of the day , some@@ times until 11 o@@ ’@@ c@@ loc@@ k at night .
While we were pione@@ ering in P@@ ine B@@ l@@ uf@@ f , we appl@@ ied to become special pione@@ ers .
Bro@@ ther Le@@ on W@@ e@@ av@@ er , now the co@@ ord@@ in@@ at@@ or of the United States Br@@ an@@ ch Com@@ mit@@ te@@ e , was appo@@ inted to serve as a circ@@ u@@ it over@@ se@@ er at the same time .
I was n@@ er@@ v@@ ous about becom@@ ing a circ@@ u@@ it over@@ se@@ er .
After I was appo@@ inted , Bro@@ ther T@@ hom@@ p@@ son was the first distr@@ ict over@@ se@@ er I served with .
In those days , a circ@@ u@@ it over@@ se@@ er received little tr@@ aining .
I rem@@ ember saying to G@@ l@@ or@@ ia , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the K@@ K@@ K hel@@ d a mar@@ ch in a t@@ own we were vis@@ iting in T@@ en@@ nes@@ see .
The following mon@@ th , we began our Be@@ the@@ l service .
G@@ l@@ or@@ ia was a j@@ ew@@ el when I married her , and she still is
Then in 199@@ 9 , I was appo@@ inted to be a m@@ ember of the G@@ over@@ ning B@@ ody .
Isaiah 32 : 17 says : “ The result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fru@@ it@@ age of true righteousness will be lasting tr@@ an@@ qu@@ ill@@ ity and sec@@ ur@@ ity . ”
S@@ ec@@ ond , we must pray for God@@ ’@@ s holy spirit .
If the house is des@@ er@@ ving , let the peace you w@@ ish it come upon it ; but if it is not des@@ er@@ ving , let the peace from you re@@ turn upon you . ”
So I gre@@ et@@ ed her in her own t@@ ong@@ ue .
T@@ ak@@ en by sur@@ pris@@ e , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your vis@@ it ? ’
I pol@@ it@@ ely told her that I w@@ ished to see the H@@ ig@@ h Com@@ mission@@ er .
She t@@ el@@ eph@@ oned the of@@ fic@@ ial , who came out to me@@ et me and gre@@ et@@ ed me in the loc@@ al language .
