Wetin we go talk about for the next topic ?
We change some people name for this topic .
See chapter 25 of the book wey dem dey call Questions Young People Ask ​ — An@@ s@@ wers That Work , V@@ ol@@ u@@ me 1 .
( Read Colossians 3 : 10 - 14 . )
E talk sey : ‘ E no matter whether person na Greek or na Jew , whether e don circum@@ ci@@ se or e never circum@@ ci@@ se , whether na stranger , or S@@ c@@ y@@ thi@@ an , whether na slave , or na free person ; but Jesus Christ na everything to everybody . ’

( Go check the first picture . ) ( b ) How e take help dem ?
One day e come go our Kingdom Hall .
The brothers love each other and dem dey do things with one mind . This one go make you see sey Jehovah hand dey . ”

We thank Jehovah for everything . ” ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
Which example Jesus show wey we need to copy ?
James still tell dem sey : ‘ Na sin e be if una continue to dey do partial . ’
Why e good make we wear love like cloth for body ?
‘ Love dey patient and e get good mind . E no dey carry shoulder up . ’
Paul talk sey im no ‘ be anything ’ If e no get love .
Na im make am send im Son as sacrifice to cover our sin . ’
Jesus talk sey : ‘ No@@ body get love wey pass this one , sey one person go die for im friends . ’
Make we see how we go take do am .
John talk sey : ‘ My pikin dem , make we love , no be for talk or for mouth , but make e show for wetin we dey do and make e dey real . ’
But I come ask myself sey , ‘ How I go take copy Jesus example as this thing happen ? ’
After I don think about wetin Jesus for do , I no make trouble with am . I just forget about the matter .
Na later I come know sey that my work@@ mate no well and stre@@ ss dey finish am .
I come tell my self sey may be e no really dey im mind to spoil my name . ”
So if we dey copy Jesus example , we go continue to show love . The third thing wey go help us na to get real love for our brothers and sisters .
And because e love us , e even die for us . ( Phil . 2 : 5 - 8 ) Make we copy the kind love wey Jesus get .
Na this one dey make us enjoy ‘ peace wey dey keep ’ us together . ( Eph .
119 : 16@@ 5 ; Isa . 5@@ 4 : 13 ) When we do everything to make peace with people , e dey show sey we really love dem .
Paul talk sey : ‘ Love dey make person grow . ’
The next day , the people wey come , many well well sotey the place no reach dem . ”
Wetin dem write for under the picture na : “ Dem full everywhere for stre@@ et . ”

( a ) Wetin make Jehovah send some angel go So@@ dom ?
( Read Ex@@ o@@ d@@ us 22 : 26 , 27 . )
( 2 Chron . 36 : 15 ) So e good make we self dey pity for people wey never know Jehovah .
Bible talk sey : ‘ E start to teach dem many things . ’
But make we do everything wey we fit do to help people now .

Because of wetin don happen for my life , I dey feel sey God no go fit love person like me .
But Jehovah don use elders and people for congregation to help me see sey e love me . E don do this one many times .
I pray make I continue to hold Jehovah tight . ”

Apostle Paul talk sey : “ God no dey do bad , to come forget all una work and the love wey una show for im name . ” ( Heb .
6 : 10 ) You no too small to plan wetin you want use your life do for Jehovah .
